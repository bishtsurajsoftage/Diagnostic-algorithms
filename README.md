DxSter, the Alzheimer's Algorithmic Diagnostic Helper.

The DxSter module takes a Clinical diagnosis (PhyDx) and the Neurophyscological diagnosis (NpDx) to output the algorithmic diagnosis (ALgDx). The idea is that the AlgDx saves time to formulate a diagnosis of an ALZ patient but  reducing the need for consensus conferences.

# Examples

## Bash And Python with CSV test data set script example
In the examples/bash folder in the GitHub repository are example files of a sample csv dataset called sample_data.csv that contains a Subject Id , NPDx, and CDR score. The file calc_algdx_sample.sh will call Python module to loop through every row in your sample data and output the AlgDx corresponding diagnosis to stdout.
